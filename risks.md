Risks 
======

Every investor should be aware that investing in companies issuing securities using Fairmint’s technology (such securities referred to herein as “FAIRs”) involves a high degree of risk, regardless of any assurance provided by the company.

There is no guarantee that:

-   Any information or projection by the company has been validated or is reliable;
-   A company will achieve its business plan or reach profitability;
-   An investor will receive a return of any part of its investment; or
-   Any investment in FAIRs will be able to be resold, or that publicly available markets will not be subject to regulatory action preventing their future access.

In addition to any specific risk factors included in a sale of FAIRs, the following considerations, among others, should be carefully evaluated before making an investment in a company offering FAIRs.

Legal and regulatory risks associated with FAIRs
------------------------------------------------

FAIRs represent a new type of security using novel technology, including blockchain technology and mathematical models that have not been tested thoroughly. While FAIRs are intended to be issued pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and other relevant, global securities laws, there is no assurance that a company will comply with all requirements mandated by such laws. In addition, there is no guarantee that the structure of FAIRs or their proposed markets will be approved by federal and international regulatory bodies. Following a mandated lockup period, there may never be an available public market pursuant to which FAIRs may be resold, and the current available mediums may be subject to regulatory action making them inaccessible in the future. Companies that issue FAIRs may also never be profitable, in which case, you may lose some or all of the value of your FAIRs. Finally, blockchain technology is subject to substantial regulatory scrutiny and uncertainty, and future regulatory actions may have a substantial impact on the value of a company issuing FAIRs.

### Risk inherent in startup or technology company investments; investors may, and frequently do, lose all of their investment

Investments in startups or technology companies (particularly early-stage ventures and emerging technology companies) involve a high degree of risk. Financial and operating risks confronting these entities are significant. While targeted returns should reflect the perceived level of risk in any investment situation, such returns may never be realized and/or may not be adequate to compensate an investor for risks taken. Loss of an investor’s entire investment is possible and can easily occur. Moreover, the timing of any return on investment is highly uncertain. This is particularly true in the case of a company offering FAIRs, as the value of their FAIRs may depend on the company reaching profitability.

The market for startups and technology companies is highly competitive and the percentage of companies that survive and prosper is small. These entities often experience unexpected problems in the areas of product development, manufacturing, marketing, financing, and general management, among others, which frequently cannot be solved. Startups or technology companies may require substantial amounts of financing, which may not be available through institutional private placements, the public markets or otherwise.

Investment in new concepts and technologies
-------------------------------------------

The value of an investor’s investment in a startup or a technology company may be susceptible to factors affecting the relevant industry and/or to greater risk than an investment in a vehicle that invests in a broader range of securities. Some of the many specific risks faced by such entities include:

-   Rapidly changing technologies;
-   Products or technologies that may quickly become obsolete;
-   Scarcity of management, technical, scientific, research and marketing personnel with appropriate training;
-   The possibility of lawsuits related to patents and intellectual property;
-   Rapidly changing investor sentiments and preferences with regard to technology sector investments (which are generally perceived as risky); or
-   Exposure to government regulation, making these companies susceptible to changes in government policy and delays or failures in securing regulatory approvals.

Changing economic conditions
----------------------------

The success of any investment activity is determined to some degree by general economic conditions. The availability, unavailability, or hindered operation of external credit markets, equity markets and other economic systems which an individual company may depend on to achieve its objectives may have a significant negative impact on a company’s operations and profitability.

The stability and sustainability of growth in global economies (and as it relates to crypto-currencies, new and emerging decentralized economies) may be impacted by terrorism, acts of war, increased regulatory scrutiny and fragmentation, or a variety of other unpredictable events. There can be no assurance that such markets and economic systems will be available or will be available as anticipated or needed for an investment in a startup or technology company to be successful.

Future and past performance
---------------------------

The past performance of a company or its management is not predictive of a company’s future results. There can be no assurance that targeted results will be achieved. Loss of principal is possible, and may be likely, on any given investment.

Difficulty in valuing startup and private technology company investments
------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is enormously difficult to determine values for any startup or private technology company. In addition to the difficulty of determining the magnitude of the risks applicable to a given company and the likelihood that its business will be a success, there may not be a market ready for a company’s FAIRs or other source of price information on arm’s length transactions, or such markets may be subject to regulatory action making such markets inaccessible. Furthermore, there is may be little–if any–public information about the operating or financial history for companies that issue FAIRs. While certain companies may offer predictions about future revenue generation opportunities and how that will impact the value of their FAIRs, investments in a company’s FAIRs will be challenging to value.

Limited Rights
--------------

FAIRs may not act as traditional equity investments in that you may not receive an equity stake in a company issuing FAIRs at all. FAIRs may never provide you with the right or ability to vote on material company matters. You may be limited only to certain profit rights or your investment may represent rights to assets not yet created by the issuer of a FAIR. An investor’s interest in an issuer of FAIRs may also represent a debt interest. Investors will be reliant on the existing management and board of directors of such companies, which may include representatives of other financial investors with whom the investor is not affiliated and whose interests may conflict with the interests of the investor. Holders of FAIRs may also have an inherent conflict with the interests of a company’s equity stakeholders.

Lack of information for monitoring and valuing issuers of FAIRs
---------------------------------------------------------------

The investor may not be able to obtain all information it wants regarding a particular company. It is possible that the investor may not be aware on a timely basis of material adverse changes that have occurred with respect to certain of its investments. As a result of these difficulties, as well as other uncertainties, an investor may not have accurate information about a company’s current value.

No assurance of additional capital for issuers of FAIRs
-------------------------------------------------------

After an investor has invested in an issuer of FAIRs, continued development and marketing of the company’s products or services, or administrative, legal, regulatory or other needs, may require that it obtain additional financing. In particular, startups and technology companies generally have substantial capital needs that are typically funded over several stages of investment. Such additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.

Absence of liquidity and public markets
---------------------------------------

An investor’s investments in FAIRs will be subject to statutory lockup periods and will generally be private, illiquid holdings that are unable to be traded on traditional securities platforms for the foreseeable future. The markets that FAIRs are intended to trade on are new and entail novel business models, which may be subject to future regulatory action that is outside of an issuer of FAIRs controls. As such, there may be no public markets for the FAIRs held by the investor, and no readily available liquidity mechanism at any particular time for any of the investments.

Tax risks
---------

There are many tax risks relating to investments in issuers of FAIRs, which are complicated and difficult to address. As a new type of security, FAIRs may be receive unexpected tax treatment by federal and international tax regulators. The structure of any investment in issuers of FAIRs may not be tax efficient for any particular investor, and no issuers of FAIRs guarantees that any particular tax result will be achieved. In addition, tax reporting requirements may be imposed on investors under the laws of the jurisdictions in which investors are liable for taxation. You should consult your tax advisor for information about the tax consequences of purchasing:

-   FAIRs;
-   debt securities of a company;
-   crypto-assets or the right to crypto-assets of a company; or
-   other unique investment instruments that may be made available to you by issuers using Fairmint’s technology.

Limited operating history of issuers of FAIRs
---------------------------------------------

An issuer of FAIRs may be a newly formed entity with little or no operating history, or it may be developing products or offerings with little or no precedent. Each offering should be evaluated on the basis that the company’s business plan and projections may not prove accurate and that the company may not achieve its objective. Past performance of an issuer of FAIRs or its team is not predictive of future results.

Diverse investors
-----------------

Investors and employees in an issuer of FAIRs may have conflicting investment, tax, and other interests with respect to company ownership, which may arise from the structuring of the company or the timing of a sale of the company or other factors. As a consequence, decisions made by the company’s management on such matters may be more beneficial for some investors than for others. Investors should be aware that company management tends to consider the investment and tax objective of its shareholders prior to other stakeholders when making decisions on investment structure or timing of sale. Company management also tends to consider the investment and tax objective of its investors as a whole and not the circumstances of any investor individually.

Need to protect digital assets
------------------------------

FAIRs are a type of digital asset which may be held in wallets controlled by a public and private key pair. There is risk that the investor could lose their digital assets due to a:

-   Breach of security;
-   Loss of the wallet (whether physically or control over);
-   Irrecoverable loss of the private key(s); or
-   Other factors.

Confidential information
------------------------

Certain information regarding the issuers of FAIRs will be highly confidential. Competitors may benefit from such information if it is ever made public, and that could result in adverse economic consequences to the investors.

Forward-looking statements
--------------------------

The information an issuer of FAIRs makes available to investors may contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often include words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "projects," "intends," "plans," "believes" and words and terms of similar substance in connection with discussions of future operating or financial performance.

Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding:

-   The adequacy of an issuer’s funding to meet its future needs;
-   The revenue and expenses expected over the life of an issuer;
-   The market for an issuer’s goods or services; or
-   Other similar matters.

Each issuer’s forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions regarding the issuer’s business and performance, the economy and other future conditions and forecasts of future events, circumstances and results. As with any projection or forecast, forward-looking statements are inherently susceptible to error, uncertainty, and changes in circumstances. The issuer’s actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements.

Important factors that could cause the issuer’s actual results to differ materially from those in its forward-looking statements include government regulation, economic, strategic, political and social conditions and the following factors:

-   Errors in estimates such as in the expected market size, expected costs of bringing a product to market, expected timelines and resources required to complete projects, and other operational and financial estimates;
-   Recent and future changes in technology, services and standards;
-   Changes in consumer behavior;
-   Changes in an issuer’s plans, initiatives and strategies, and consumer acceptance thereof;
-   Changes in the plans, initiatives and strategies of the third parties that are necessary or important to the issuer’s success;
-   Competitive pressures, including as a result of changes in technology;
-   The issuer's ability to deal effectively with economic slowdowns or other economic or market difficulties;
-   Increased volatility or decreased liquidity in the capital markets, including any limitation on the issuer’s ability to access the capital markets for debt securities, refinance its outstanding indebtedness or obtain equity, debt or bank financings on acceptable terms;
-   The failure to meet earnings expectations;
-   The failure to comply with federal, state and foreign regulations as they related to securities offerings and exchanges;
-   Regulatory action against the exchanges or other markets where an issuer’s securities are listed or made available for resale;
-   The adequacy of an issuer’s risk management framework;
-   Changes in U.S. GAAP or other applicable accounting policies;
-   The impact of terrorist acts, hostilities, natural disasters (including extreme weather) and pandemic viruses;
-   A disruption or failure of the issuer's or its vendors' network and information systems or other technology upon which the issuer's businesses rely;
-   Changes in tax, federal communication and other laws and regulations;
-   Digital systems being compromised by hacking, forking and hostile take-over;
-   Changes in foreign exchange rates and in the stability and existence of foreign currencies; or
-   Other risks and uncertainties which may or may not be specifically discussed in materials provided to investors.

Any forward-looking statement made by an issuer speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Issuers are under no obligation to, and generally they expressly disclaim any obligation to, update or alter their forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or otherwise.

*The foregoing risks do not purport to be a complete explanation of all the risks involved in acquiring FAIRs. Each investor is urged to seek their own independent legal and tax advice and read the relevant investment documents before deciding to invest in an issuer of FAIRs.*
