### **What Information does Fairmint Collect?**

**Information You Provide to Us:** We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, this includes information you provide when you create your account, comment on a part of our website, provide your passport or identification-document, or provide us with access to your accounts on third-party sites (“***Third-Party Sites***”). If you choose to invest through our Site, we will collect financial information from you, such as your digital asset wallet information (including wallets you may have created through the use of our Services), financial account information other payment information, and we may collect information to verify your income or net-worth.

**Information Collected Automatically:** Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. “***Cookies***” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. If you click on a link to a third party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your browser or device. For more information, please review our [Cookie Policy](https://github.com/Fairmint/legal/blob/master/cookie-policy.md).

We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve the Services - for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.

**Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy:** Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Do Not Track signals are set on a browser-by-browser basis, so you must set them on every browser you use if you do not wish to be tracked. Remember that this is just our Do Not Track policy, and we can’t and don’t make any promises about how third parties react when you set this signal on your browser.

**Testimonials**: We may collect and display personal testimonials of satisfied users of our Services in addition to other endorsements. With your consent, we may post your testimonial along with your Personal Information, on the Services. If you wish to update or delete your testimonial, please contact us at contact@fairmint.co.

We do not rent or sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this below:

-   **Information that’s been de-identified.** We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual.
-   **Affiliated Businesses:** In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. We have no control over the policies and practices of third-party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.
-   **Our Agents:** We may employ other companies and people such as escrow agents, transfer agents, counsels, advisors, accountants, banks and other financial service providers, to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.

These services may collect and retain some information about you, such as the IP address assigned to you on the date you use the Services, but not your name or other personally identifying information. We may combine the information generated through the use of these services with your Personal Information but never in a way that will identify you to any other user. Although these services may plant a persistent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you use the Services, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google or Intercom, as applicable.
